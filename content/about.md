<div style="text-align: justify;"> I am open source enthusiastic. I started my journey in the world of binary digits from school. I love electronics and software, learning new things daily. I always try to put my imagination into this world using my hardware and software knowledge.</div>

As a profession, I choose software but I love to spend time on electronics basically on IoT. I choose [Python](https://www.python.org/) as my main language. For controllers, I used [Embedded C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_C). I know other languages like [Go](https://golang.org/), [HTML](https://html.com/), [php](http://www.php.net/), [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) etc.

Currently working with [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) as Associate Quality Engineer. I am contributing to [ManageIQ](https://github.com/ManageIQ) mainly [integration tests](https://github.com/ManageIQ/integration_tests) repository. It's totally written in python with great automation frameworks like [widgetastic](https://github.com/RedHatQE/widgetastic.core) and [navmazing](https://github.com/RedHatQE/navmazing).

I was fellow of [India Meteorological Department (IMD)](http://www.imdpune.gov.in/), there I was working mainly with the scientific library of python for meteorological application development. I wrote GribReader, SYNOP Decoder and AMO mailing client and Server and proposed  Mini Automatic Weather Station for rural areas in India. I was project student at [Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS)](http://www.imdpune.gov.in/) contribute to [Dam Parameter Monitoring System](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8079375/?reload=true) prototype.

I like to contribute to the Open Source community. Participating in various meetup mainly [Python Pune](http://pune.python.org.in/). In free time spending time with the students taking the session on [Python](https://www.python.org/), [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) etc. I visit campuses as a resource person.
